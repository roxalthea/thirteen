# thirteen
Personal Project creating a card game called 'Thirteen', written in Java

## Game Details

- It is a hierarchy style card game in that, Hearts > Diamonds > Clubs > Spades;
- 2 > A > K > Q > J > 10 ... 5 > 4 > 3
- The game supports 2 to 4 players
- At the start of the game, each player is shuffled and drawn 13 cards from the deck
- The winning condition is the 1st player to empty their hand; granting them significantly more points than the other placements
